This is my approach of implementing a poor mans i3wm for windows. It uses an autohotkey script that maps certain key combinations to the F13 and onwards buttons, and a powershell script running in the background that picks up those keys to do the actual functionality. I doubt this is helpful for anyone, but feel free to use it, and hit me up if there is anything unclear.
